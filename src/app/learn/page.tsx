      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to the learning section of our platform. This space is dedicated to explaining our goals,
        how premium KNS domain sales contribute to the broader Rednose token project, and the future benefits 
        for our early supporters.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What We're Doing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While we are not the creators of the Kaspa Name System (KNS), we actively curate and sell premium 
        KNS domains as digital assets. These domains are part of the Kaspa ecosystem and provide identity, 
        branding, and utility on-chain.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Premium Domains?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Short, memorable names ideal for wallets and dApps</li>
        <li>Strong potential for future resale value</li>
        <li>Ownership tied to identity in the Kaspa ecosystem</li>
        <li>Scarcity and exclusivity of top-tier names</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Funding the Rednose Token Project</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The funds raised from premium domain sales directly support the development and launch of the Rednose token.
        This includes liquidity, marketing, development, and ecosystem growth. Your purchase not only secures a valuable 
        domain but also helps build the future of Rednose.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Token Allocation for Domain Buyers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As a thank-you to our early supporters, a portion of the future Rednose token supply will be allocated to verified
        domain buyers. Eligibility and allocation may depend on factors like domain value, age, or ownership snapshot dates.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 text-sm text-gray-600">
        Stay tuned for updates on snapshots, airdrop timelines, and the Rednose token launch. Your domain might unlock 
        more than you expect.
